        <p>I'm Julie, I'm the amazing developer behind this fantastic website. I'm currently a student at NBCC and am also interning part time at HotSpot parking, 
            because I'm passionate about making parking in downtown Fredericton better for everyone!
        <br>Maybe come check this website out again once I learn javascript, I'm sure it'll be a lot more fun.</p>
